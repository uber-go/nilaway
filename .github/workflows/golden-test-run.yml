name: Golden Test

# NilAway output may change due to introduction of new feature or bug fixes. Since NilAway is still
# at early stage of development, constantly updating / maintaining the golden test output will be
# a burden. Therefore, we run this as a separate CI job and post the differences as a PR comment
# for manual reviews.
#
# Note that this workflow is triggered on `pull_request` event, where if the PR is created from
# forked repository, the GITHUB_TOKEN will not have necessary write permission to post the comments.
# To work around this (and to provide proper isolation), we follow the recommended approach [1] of
# separating job into two parts: (1) build and upload results as artifacts in untrusted environment
# (here), and then (2) trigger a follow-up job that downloads the artifacts and posts the comment in
# trusted environment (see .github/workflows/golden-test-comment.yml).

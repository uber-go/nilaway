NilAway is a static analysis tool that seeks to help developers avoid nil panics in production by catching them at
compile time rather than runtime. NilAway is similar to the standard
[nilness analyzer](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/nilness), however, it employs much more
sophisticated and powerful static analysis techniques to track nil flows within a package as well _across_ packages, and
report errors providing users with the nilness flows for easier debugging.

NilAway enjoys three key properties that make it stand out:

- It is **fully-automated**: NilAway is equipped with an inference engine, making it require _no_ any additional
  information from the developers (e.g., annotations) besides standard Go code.

- It is **fast**: we have designed NilAway to be fast and scalable, making it suitable for large codebases. In our
  measurements, we have observed less than 5% build-time overhead when NilAway is enabled. We are also constantly applying
  optimizations to further reduce its footprint.

- It is **practical**: it does not prevent _all_ possible nil panics in your code, but it catches most of the potential
  nil panics we have observed in production, allowing NilAway to maintain a good balance between usefulness and build-time
  overhead.

## Running NilAway

NilAway is implemented using the standard [go/analysis][go-analysis], making it easy to integrate with existing analyzer
drivers (i.e., [golangci-lint][golangci-lint], [nogo][nogo], or [running as a standalone checker][singlechecker]).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> By default, NilAway analyzes _all_ Go code, including the standard libraries and dependencies. This helps NilAway
> better understand the code form dependencies and reduce its false negatives. However, this would also incur a
> significant performance cost (only once for drivers with modular support) and increase the number of non-actionable
> errors in dependencies, for large Go projects with a lot of dependencies.
>
> We highly recommend using the [include-pkgs][include-pkgs-flag] flag to narrow down the analysis to your project's
> code exclusively. This directs NilAway to skip analyzing dependencies (e.g., third-party libraries), allowing you to
> focus solely on potential nil panics reported by NilAway in your first-party code!

### Standalone Checker

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Due to the sophistication of the analyses that NilAway does, NilAway caches its findings about a
> particular package via the [Fact Mechanism][fact-mechanism] from the [go/analysis][go-analysis]
> framework. Therefore, it is _highly_ recommended to leverage a driver that supports modular
> analysis (i.e., bazel/nogo or golangci-lint, but _not_ the standalone checker since it stores all
> facts in memory) for better performance on large projects. The standalone checker is provided
> more for evaluation purposes since it is easy to get started.

Install the binary from source by running:

```shell
go install go.uber.org/nilaway/cmd/nilaway@latest
```

Then, run the linter by:

```shell
nilaway -include-pkgs="<YOUR_PKG_PREFIX>,<YOUR_PKG_PREFIX_2>" ./...
```

> [!TIP]  
> Disable the `pretty-print` flag when output as JSON:
>
> ```shell
> nilaway -json -pretty-print=false -include-pkgs="<YOUR_PKG_PREFIX>,<YOUR_PKG_PREFIX_2>" ./...
> ```

### golangci-lint (>= v1.57.0)

NilAway, in its current form, can report false positives. This unfortunately hinders its immediate
merging in [golangci-lint][golangci-lint] and be offered as a linter (see [PR#4045][pr-4045]).
Therefore, you need to build NilAway as a plugin to golangci-lint to be executed as a private
linter. There are two plugin systems in golangci-lint, and it is much easier to use the
[Module Plugin System][golangci-lint-module-plugin] (introduced since v1.57.0), and it is the only
supported approach to run NilAway in golangci-lint.

(1) Create a `.custom-gcl.yml` file at the root of the repository if you have not done so, add the
following content:

```yaml
# This has to be >= v1.57.0 for module plugin system support.
version: v1.57.0
plugins:
  - module: "go.uber.org/nilaway"
    import: "go.uber.org/nilaway/cmd/gclplugin"
    version: latest # Or a fixed version for reproducible builds.
```

(2) Add NilAway to the linter configuration file `.golangci.yaml`:

For golangci-lint v2:

```yaml
version: "2"
linters:
  enable:
    - nilaway
  settings:
    custom:
      nilaway:
        type: module
        description: Static analysis tool to detect potential nil panics in Go code.
        settings:
          # Settings must be a "map from string to string" to mimic command line flags: the keys are
          # flag names and the values are the values to the particular flags.
          include-pkgs: "<YOUR_PACKAGE_PREFIXES>"
```

<details>

<summary>For golangci-lint v1:</summary>

```yaml
linters-settings:
  custom:
    nilaway:
      type: "module"
      description: Static analysis tool to detect potential nil panics in Go code.
      settings:
        # Settings must be a "map from string to string" to mimic command line flags: the keys are
        # flag names and the values are the values to the particular flags.
        include-pkgs: "<YOUR_PACKAGE_PREFIXES>"
# NilAway can be referred to as `nilaway` just like any other golangci-lint analyzers in other
# parts of the configuration file.
```

</details>

(3) Build a custom golangci-lint binary with NilAway included:

```shell
# Note that your `golangci-lint` to bootstrap the custom binary must also be version >= v1.57.0.
$ golangci-lint custom
```

By default, the custom binary will be built at `.` with the name `custom-gcl`, which can be further
customized in `.custom-gcl.yml` file (see [Module Plugin System][golangci-lint-module-plugin] for
instructions).

> [!TIP]  
> Cache the custom binary to avoid having to build it again to save resources, you can use the
> hash of the `.custom-gcl.yml` file as the cache key if you are using a fixed version of NilAway.
> If you are using `latest` as NilAway version, you can append the date of build to the cache key
> to force cache expiration after certain time period.

(4) Run the custom binary instead of `golangci-lint`:

```shell
# Arguments are the same as `golangci-lint`.
$ ./custom-gcl run ./...
```

### Bazel/nogo

Running with bazel/nogo requires slightly more efforts. First follow the instructions from [rules_go][rules-go],
[gazelle][gazelle], and [nogo][nogo] to set up your Go project such that it can be built with bazel/nogo with no or
default set of linters configured. Then,

(1) Add `import _ "go.uber.org/nilaway"` to your `tools.go` file (or other file that you use for configuring tool
dependencies, see [How can I track tool dependencies for a module?][track-tool-dependencies] from Go Modules
documentation) to avoid `go mod tidy` from removing NilAway as a tool dependency.

(2) Run the following commands to add NilAway as a tool dependency to your project:

```bash
# Get NilAway as a dependency, as well as getting its transitive dependencies in go.mod file.
$ go get go.uber.org/nilaway@latest
# This should not remove NilAway as a dependency in your go.mod file.
$ go mod tidy
# Run gazelle to sync dependencies from go.mod to WORKSPACE file.
$ bazel run //:gazelle -- update-repos -from_file=go.mod
```

(3) Add NilAway to nogo configurations (usually in top-level `BUILD.bazel` file):

```diff
nogo(
    name = "my_nogo",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],  # must have public visibility
    deps = [
+       "@org_uber_go_nilaway//:go_default_library",
+       "@org_uber_go_nilaway//config:go_default_library",  # Add this line if your have rules_go < 0.55.0
    ],
    config = "config.json",
)
```

(4) Run bazel build to see NilAway working (any nogo error will stop the bazel build, you can use the `--keep_going`
flag to request bazel to build as much as possible):

```bash
$ bazel build --keep_going //...
```

(5) See [nogo documentation][nogo-configure-analyzers] on how to pass a configuration JSON to the nogo driver, and see
our [wiki page][nogo-configure-nilaway] on how to pass configurations to NilAway.

## Code Examples

Let's look at a few examples to see how NilAway can help prevent nil panics.

```go
// Example 1:
var p *P
if someCondition {
      p = &P{}
}
print(p.f) // nilness reports NO error here, but NilAway does.
```

In this example, the local variable `p` is only initialized when `someCondition` is true. At the field access `p.f`, a
panic may occur if `someCondition` is false. NilAway is able to catch this potential nil flow and reports the following
error showing this nilness flow:

```
go.uber.org/example.go:12:9: error: Potential nil panic detected. Observed nil flow from source to dereference point:
    - go.uber.org/example.go:12:9: unassigned variable `p` accessed field `f`
```

If we guard this dereference with a nilness check (`if p != nil`), the error goes away.

NilAway is also able to catch nil flows across functions. For example, consider the following code snippet:

```go
// Example 2:
func foo() *int {
      return nil
}
func bar() {
     print(*foo()) // nilness reports NO error here, but NilAway does.
}
```

In this example, the function `foo` returns a nil pointer, which is directly dereferenced in `bar`, resulting in a panic
whenever `bar` is called. NilAway is able to catch this potential nil flow and reports the following error, describing
the nilness flow across function boundaries:

```
go.uber.org/example.go:23:13: error: Potential nil panic detected. Observed nil flow from source to dereference point:
    - go.uber.org/example.go:20:14: literal `nil` returned from `foo()` in position 0
    - go.uber.org/example.go:23:13: result 0 of `foo()` dereferenced
```

Note that in the above example, `foo` does not necessarily have to reside in the same package as `bar`. NilAway is able
to track nil flows across packages as well. Moreover, NilAway handles Go-specific language constructs such as receivers,
interfaces, type assertions, type switches, and more.

## Configurations

We expose a set of flags via the standard flag passing mechanism in [go/analysis](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis).
Please check [wiki/Configuration](https://github.com/uber-go/nilaway/wiki/Configuration) to see the available flags and
how to pass them using different linter drivers.

## Support

We follow the same [version support policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy) as the [Go](https://golang.org/)
project: we support and test the last two major versions of Go.

Please feel free to [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/uber-go/nilaway/issues) if you have any questions, bug
reports, and feature requests.

NilAway is a static analysis tool that seeks to help developers avoid nil panics in production by catching them at 
compile time rather than runtime. NilAway is similar to the standard
[nilness analyzer](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/nilness), however, it employs much more 
sophisticated and powerful static analysis techniques to track nil flows within a package as well _across_ packages, and
report errors providing users with the nilness flows for easier debugging.

NilAway enjoys three key properties that make it stand out:

* It is **fully-automated**: NilAway is equipped with an inference engine, making it require _no_ any additional 
information from the developers (e.g., annotations) besides standard Go code.

* It is **fast**: we have designed NilAway to be fast and scalable, making it suitable for large codebases. In our
measurements, we have observed less than 5% build-time overhead when NilAway is enabled. We are also constantly applying
optimizations to further reduce its footprint.

* It is **practical**: it does not prevent _all_ possible nil panics in your code, but it catches most of the potential
nil panics we have observed in production, allowing NilAway to maintain a good balance between usefulness and build-time 
overhead.

## Installation

NilAway is implemented using the standard [go/analysis](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis) framework, 
making it easy to integrate with existing analyzer drivers (e.g., [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint),
[nogo](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/master/go/nogo.rst), or 
[running as a standalone checker](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/singlechecker)). Here, we list the 
instructions for running NilAway as a standalone checker. More integration supports will be added soon.

### Standalone Checker

Install the binary from source by running: 
```shell
go install go.uber.org/nilaway/cmd/nilaway@latest
```

Then, run the linter by:
```shell
nilaway ./...
```

## Code Examples

Let's look at a few examples to see how NilAway can help prevent nil panics.

```go
// Example 1:
var p *P
if someCondition {
      p = &P{}
}
print(p.f) // nilness reports NO error here, but NilAway does.
```

In this example, the local variable `p` is only initialized when `someCondition` is true. At the field access `p.f`, a
panic may occur if `someCondition` is false. NilAway is able to catch this potential nil flow and reports the following
error showing this nilness flow:

```
go.uber.org/example.go:12:9: error: Potential nil panic detected. Observed nil flow from source to dereference point:
    -> go.uber.org/example.go:12:9: unassigned variable `p` accessed field `f`
```

If we guard this dereference with a nilness check (`if p != nil`), the error goes away.

NilAway is also able to catch nil flows across functions. For example, consider the following code snippet:

```go
// Example 2:
func foo() *int {
      return nil
}
func bar() {
     print(*foo()) // nilness reports NO error here, but NilAway does.
}
```

In this example, the function `foo` returns a nil pointer, which is directly dereferenced in `bar`, resulting in a panic
whenever `bar` is called. NilAway is able to catch this potential nil flow and reports the following error, describing
the nilness flow across function boundaries: 

```
go.uber.org/example.go:23:13: error: Potential nil panic detected. Observed nil flow from source to dereference point:
    -> go.uber.org/example.go:20:14: literal `nil` returned from `foo()` in position 0
    -> go.uber.org/example.go:23:13: result 0 of `foo()` dereferenced
```

Note that in the above example, `foo` does not necessarily have to reside in the same package as `bar`. NilAway is able
to track nil flows across packages as well. Moreover, NilAway handles Go-specific language constructs such as receivers,
interfaces, type assertions, type switches, and more. For more detailed discussion, please check our paper.

## Configurations

We expose a set of flags via the standard flag passing mechanism in [go/analysis](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis).
Please check [wiki/Configuration](https://github.com/uber-go/nilaway/wiki/Configuration) to see the available flags and
how to pass them using different linter drivers.

## Support 

We follow the same [version support policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy) as the [Go](https://golang.org/) 
project: we support and test the last two major versions of Go.

Please feel free to [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/uber-go/nilaway/issues) if you have any questions, bug 
reports, and feature requests.

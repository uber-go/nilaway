This test aims to make sure that looping control flow is correctly captured by the fixed point
algorithm. It's TP and TN cases reflect loops that may or may not, respectively, flow a nil value
into the return of a non-nil returning function, which would trigger an error. More than 2
iterations are required to observe the correct behavior.
